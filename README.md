# Mental Health Predictor

## Selected Topic
- Predicting mental health severity in United States based on variety of socioeconomic and enviornmental factors including, but not limited to:
  - populaton density
  - annual income
  - water and land features
## Reason for Selecting Topic
- Building a model that can predict mental health risk for an individual
- The prediction can provide awareness needed to address mental health concerns
## Description of Data Sources
- 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2019. 500 Cities: Mental health not good for >=14 days among adults aged >=18 years ---[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Mental-health-not-good-for-14-days-amon/i2ek-k3pa)
  - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016)
    - Mental Health Severity: Respondents aged ≥18 years who report 14 or more days during the past 30 days during which their mental health was not good. 
- US Household Income Statistics---[Golden Oak Research Group LLC, “U.S. Income Database Kaggle”. Publication: 5, August 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations/version/1)
- United States Cities Database---[SimpleMaps.com, Pareto Software LLC, compiled data from U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Census Bureau](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities)
## Questions Hoping to Answer
- What are the most and least significant factors in predicting mental health severity?
## Communication Protocols
- Keeping updated on the status of each of our parts in the project and general project status, each team member regularly communicates through Slack messaging and Zoom meetings.
